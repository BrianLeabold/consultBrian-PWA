                  voted unanimously in an attempt to fight the affordable housing crisis.
                  The county will spend $11 million over five years. This trial
                  program waives fees to encourage homeowners to build “granny flats”
                  on their properties.

              <p>This program follows the State of California law that was passed
                in 2018. The state law eased restrictions and allows property owners
                to build more granny flats. The San Diego county law immediately
                waives building permit fees, onsite waste water fees and development
                impact fees, which include transportation fees to add roads and
                infrastructure, fees to build parks, and drainage fees; for homeowners
                who want to build granny flats.
              </p>
              <p>The county's regulations allow property owner to build rental
                units up to 1,200 sq ft, and may be attached to or built separately
                from existing homes on the same parcel of land. They cannot be
                sold separately and must meet all zoning requirements. This is
                great for those property owners that have been considering a
                project like this. By waiving permit and development fees, owners
                can save a quite a bit of money.

        Quality is like buy oats. If you want good clean oats, you need to pay
        a fair price. But if you are ok with oats that have already been through
        the horse, well those a a bit cheaper.
