    <p class="lead">Grandson of a carpenter Son of a remodeler</p>
        <p>I started swinging a hammer the summer I turned 12. Nailing down plywood sub-floor by hand, side
          by side with my grand-dad and my father, is a fond memory that has fueled my love of construction all my
          life. Through out high school I worked for my dad on the weekends and over summer vacations. He taught me
          about dealing with other trades, suppliers and our own customers.
        </p>
        <p>Then in September of my senior year of high school, I decided to join the Navy. Building on what I
          learned working for my father, I learned more about people and their plethora of personalities. I was able
          to see places and things that has fueled my ability to envision the big picture, yet focus on important details
          that make my projects feel complete.

        <p>It's never easy managing large construction/remodeling projects. By setting up timelines and goals with

      Quality is like buy oats. If you want good clean oats, you need to pay
      a fair price. But if you are ok with oats that have already been through
      the horse, well those a a bit cheaper.
